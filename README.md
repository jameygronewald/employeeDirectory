## Description
Employee Directory is a front-end React app that displays a table of dynamically generated employee information and allows the user to filter and sort through the directory. The app uses the node package Axios to make a call to a 3rd party API called Random User Generator, and then uses array methods to manipulate state and update the employee table via user interaction with an input and dropdown.
